# .smaller[Two-sample Location Tests]

In practice, we often encounter problems where our goal is .pink[to compare the means (or locations) of two samples]. For example,
1. A scientist is interested in comparing the vaccine efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna vaccine.
2. A bank wants to know which of two proposed plans will most increase the use of its credit cards.
3. A psychologist wants to compare male and female college students' impression on a selected webpage.

We will discuss three ".pink[two-sample location tests]":
1. .purple[Two independent sample Student's t-test]
2. .purple[Two independent sample Welch's t-test]
3. .purple[Two independent sample Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test]

# .smaller[Two Independent Sample Student's t-test]

This test considers the following assumed model for group .hi-purple2[A] and .hi-blue[B]

$$X_{i(g)} = \color{#eb078e}{\mu_{g}} + \varepsilon_{i(g)} = \mu + \color{#eb078e}{\delta_{g}} + \varepsilon_{i(g)},$$
where $g=A,B$, $i=1,...,n_{g}$, $\varepsilon_{i(g)} \overset{iid}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,\color{#eb078e}{\sigma^{2}})$ and $\sum n_{g}\delta_{g} = \color{#6A5ACD}{\delta_A} + \color{#06bcf1}{\delta_B}=0$. 

📝 $\color{#6A5ACD}{n_A}$ $=$ sample size of group .hi-purple2[A], $\color{#6A5ACD}{\mu_{A} = \mu + \delta_A}$ $=$ population mean of group .purple2[A], $\color{#06bcf1}{n_B}$ and $\color{#06bcf1}{\mu_{B} = \mu + \delta_B}$ are similarly defined for group .hi-blue[B].

Hypotheses:

$$H_0: \color{#6A5ACD}{\mu_A} - \color{#06bcf1}{\mu_B} \color{#eb078e}{=} \mu_0 \ \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \ H_a: \color{#6A5ACD}{\mu_A} - \color{#06bcf1}{\mu_B} \ \big[ \color{#eb078e}{>} \text{ or } \color{#eb078e}{<} \text{ or } \color{#eb078e}{\neq} \big] \ \mu_0.$$

Test statistic's distribution under $H_0$

$$\color{#b4b4b4}{T = \frac{(\overline{X}_{A}-\overline{X}_{B})-\mu_0}{s_{p}\sqrt{n_{A}^{-1}+n_{B}^{-1}}} \ {\underset{H_0}{\sim}} \ \text{Student}(n_{A}+n_{B}-2).}$$

# .smaller[Discussion - Student's t-test]

- R function: 

.center[
`t.test(x = ..., y = ..., alternative = ..., var.equal = TRUE)`.]

- This test strongly relies on the .pink[assumed absence of outliers]. If outliers appear to be present the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test (see later) is (probably) a better option.
- For moderate and small sample sizes, the sample distribution should be at least .pink[approximately normal] with no strong skewness to ensure the reliability of the test.
- In practice, the assumption of equal variance is hard to verify and .hi.pink[we recommend avoiding this test in practice].

# .smaller[Two Independent Sample Welch's t-test]

This test considers the following assumed model for group .hi-purple2[A] and .hi-blue[B]

$$X_{i(g)} = \color{#eb078e}{\mu_{g}} + \varepsilon_{i(g)} = \mu + \color{#eb078e}{\delta_{g}} + \varepsilon_{i(g)},$$
where $g=A,B$, $i=1,...,n_{g}$, $\varepsilon_{i(g)} \overset{iid}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,\color{#eb078e}{\sigma^{2}_g})$ and $\sum n_{g}\delta_{g} = \color{#6A5ACD}{\delta_A} + \color{#06bcf1}{\delta_B}=0$. 

📝 $\color{#6A5ACD}{n_A}$ $=$ sample size of group .hi-purple2[A], $\color{#6A5ACD}{\mu_{A} = \mu + \delta_A}$ $=$ population mean of group .purple2[A], $\color{#06bcf1}{n_B}$ and $\color{#06bcf1}{\mu_{B} = \mu + \delta_B}$ are similarly defined for group .hi-blue[B].

Hypotheses: 

$$H_0: \color{#6A5ACD}{\mu_A} - \color{#06bcf1}{\mu_B} \color{#eb078e}{=} \mu_0 \ \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \ H_a: \color{#6A5ACD}{\mu_A} - \color{#06bcf1}{\mu_B} \ \big[ \color{#eb078e}{>} \text{ or } \color{#eb078e}{<} \text{ or } \color{#eb078e}{\neq} \big] \ \mu_0.$$

Test statistic's distribution under $H_0$

$$\color{#b4b4b4}{T = \frac{(\overline{X}_{A}-\overline{X}_{B})-\mu_0}{\sqrt{s^2_A/n_{A} + s^2_B/n_{B}}} \ {\underset{H_0}{\sim}} \ \text{Student}(df).}$$

# .smaller[Discussion - Welch's t-test]

- For moderate and small sample sizes, the sample distribution should be at least .pink[approximately normal] with no strong skewness to ensure the reliability of the test.
- This test does not require the variances of the two groups to be equal. If the variances of the two groups are the same (which is rather unlikely in practice), the Welch's t-test losses a little bit of power compared to the Student's t-test.
- The computation of $df$ (i.e. the degrees of freedom of the distribution under the null) is beyond the scope of this class.

# .smaller[Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test]

This test considers the following assumed model for group .hi-purple2[A] and .hi-blue[B]

$$X_{i(g)} = \color{#eb078e}{\theta_{g}} + \varepsilon_{i(g)} = \theta + \color{#eb078e}{\delta_{g}} + \varepsilon_{i(g)},$$
where $g=A,B$, $i=1,...,n_{g}$, $\varepsilon_{i(g)} \overset{iid}{\sim} (0,\color{#eb078e}{\sigma^{2}})$ and $\sum n_{g}\delta_{g} = \color{#6A5ACD}{\delta_A} + \color{#06bcf1}{\delta_B}=0$.

# .smaller[Discussion - Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test]

- R function: 

.center[
`wilcox.test(x = ..., y = ..., alternative = ...)`.]

- This test is ".pink[robust]" in the sense that (unlike the t-test) it is not overly affected by outliers.
- The Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test does not require the distributions to be Gaussian nor the variances to be the same, however, in this case this method actually tests whether the two distributions are the same. To render the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test comparable to the t-tests we need to assume: (1) The distribution is symmetric, (2) the variances are the same. Then, we have $\color{#6A5ACD}{\theta_A = \mu_A}$ and $\color{#06bcf1}{\theta_B = \mu_B}$.
- Compared to the t-tests, the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test is less power if their requirements (Gaussian and possibly same variances) are met.
- The distribution of this method under the null is complicated and can be obtained by different methods (e.g. exact, asymptotic normal, ...). The details are beyond the scope of this class.

# Problems with multiple samples

In practice, we often even encounter situations where we need to .pink[compare the means of more than 2 groups]. For example,

1. A scientist wants to compare the vaccine efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech, the Moderna, and the Sputnik V vaccines.
2. A nutritionist wants to compare the weight loss efficacy of several diets.

# ☠️ Multiple testing can be dangerous!

- .smaller[Remember that a p-value is .hi-pink[random] as its value depends on the data.]
- .smaller[Hence, by chance, it might happen that while the null hypothesis cannot be rejected (supposing it is true), that the p-value is smaller than the set threshold. With the latter chosen as 5%, then, on average, the (sample) p-value is below 5% .purple[once in twenty times!]]
- .smaller[If multiple hypotheses are tested, the chance of observing a rare event increases, and therefore, the chance to incorrectly reject a null hypothesis (i.e., making a Type I error) increases.]
- .smaller[Hence .hi-pink[performing multiple tests, with the same or different data, is dangerous ⚠️] (but very common! 😟) as it automatically leads to .pink[significant results, when actually there are none!]]

# Methods to remedy such problem

- .smallest[The .hi-pink[Bonferroni correction] is one of the oldest methods proposed to counteract the problem of multiple testing (i.e. potential increased chance to make Type I errors). ]
- .smallest[.purple[It tests each individual hypothesis at a reduced significance level.] For example, if a trial is testing 20 hypotheses with a desired] $\small \alpha = 5\%$.smallest[, then the Bonferroni correction would test each individual hypothesis at] $\small \alpha^* = \alpha/20 = 5\% / 20 = 0.25\%$.smallest[. Therefore, .purple[it controls the familywise error rate at]] $\small \color{#6A5ACD}{\leq \alpha}$.
- .smallest[The Bonferroni correction can be .turquoise[conservative] if there are a large number of tests, as it comes at the cost of reducing the power of the tests.]
- .smallest[Another more recent and less conservative method is the .hi-pink[False Discovery Rate (FDR)]. It provides less stringent control of Type I errors compared to the Bonferroni correction. Thus, the FDR has greater power, yet at the cost of increased numbers of Type I errors.]

# Wilcoxon rank sum test

- .smallest[Similar to the Wilcoxon signed rank test as a robust <sup>.smallest[👋]</sup> alternative to the one-sample t-test, we can use the .hi-pink[Wilcoxon rank sum test] (also called the Mann-Whitney test) when the normality condition is not satisfied to use two-sample t-test.]
- .smallest[The Wilcoxon rank sum test depends on the .purple[Wilcoxon rank sum statistic], which is the .purple[sum of the ranks of one sample]. As it only uses the ranks of the observations, it is a .turquoise[nonparametric test].]

The usual one-sample and two-sample t-tests are somehow robust in the sense that their results of inference are not very sensitive to moderate lack of normality when the samples are sufficiently large.

4. .smallest[.purple[Conclusion:] We have p-value <] $\small \alpha$ .smallest[so we can reject the null hypothesis at the significance level of 5% and conclude that the early eaters tend to lose more weight compared to late eaters.]
