# .smallest[Motivating Example: Reading Ability]

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Problem]
An educator believes that new directed reading activities in the classroom can help elementary school students (6-12 years old) improve their reading ability. She arranged a pilot study where some students (chosen at random) of age 6 start to take part in these activities .hi-purple2[(treatment group)], meanwhile other students continue with the classical curriculum .hi-pink[(control group)]. After three years, the educator wishes to evaluate the effectiveness of these activities so all students are given a Degree of Reading Power (DRP) test, which assesses their reading ability.

.pink[Can we conclude that these new directed reading activities can help elementary school students improve their reading ability?]
]
.panel[.panel-name[Data]

```{r}
dat = read.csv("data/reading.csv")
control = dat$score[dat$group == "Control"]
head(control)
treatment = dat$score[dat$group == "Treatment"]
head(treatment)
```

]
.panel[.panel-name[Graph]

```{R, readingboxplot, out.width = "80%", echo = F}
include_graphics("pics/boxplot_reading.png")
```

]
.panel[.panel-name[Test]
1. .purple[Define hypotheses:] $H_0: \mu_T = \mu_C$ and $H_a: \mu_T > \mu_C$.
2. .purple[Define] $\color{#6A5ACD}{\alpha}$: We consider $\alpha = 5\%$.
3. .purple[Compute p-value]: p-value = $97.12\%$ (see R code tab for details).
4. .purple[Conclusion:] We have p-value > $\alpha$ so we cannot reject the null hypothesis at the significance level of 5%. 

.hi-pink[Remark:] Notice that the p-value for the test with opposite hypotheses is actually $100-97.12\%=2.88\% < \alpha$ (Why? 🤔). So we conclude, at the significance level of 5%, that the classical curriculum without these new directed reading activities actually improve students' reading ability more compared to the curriculum with these activities. 😬

# .smaller[Is our analysis comprehensive?]

The educator points out that she has considered these new directed reading activities for only three years. So only students of 6-8 years old have participated in these activities. In other words, in the sample she collected, the students in the treatment group are only of age 6 to 8, whereas the students in the control group vary from 6 to 12 years old. .pink[Is age a potential explanation to the difference we observe among the students' reading ability?]

To make sure that the analysis is reliable, she includes the age information of the students, which can be accessed as follows:

```{r}
treatment_age = dat$age[dat$group == "Treatment"]
control_age   = dat$age[dat$group == "Control"]
```

# .smaller[Should age be taken into account?]

# .smaller[Regression analysis]

- Regression analysis corresponds a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome variable') and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', or 'features').
- .pink[Regression methods] allow to study the effects of some explanatory variables (also called covariates or regressors) $ X_1, \ldots, X_p$ on a response variable $Y$ of primary interest. They are used to reveal and investigate the relationships between input and output variables.]
- The relationship between the response variable $\small Y$ and the covariates is not .purple2[deterministic]. Instead, it shows some random errors. In other words, the response $\small Y$ is random and its .purple2[(conditional) expected value] (i.e. $\mathbb{E}[Y | X_1, \ldots, X_p]$) is modeled as a function of the covariates.

---

# r
- .smallest[In .hi-pink[linear regression models], the mean value of] $\small Y$ .smallest[is a linear combination of the covariates:] 
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \ldots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2).$$
- .smallest[.purple[The random errors are assumed to be independently and identically normally distributed with mean 0 and variance]] $\small \color{#6A5ACD}{\sigma^2}$ .smallest[.purple[.]]
- .smallest[The parameters of interest are] $\small \beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$<sup>.smallest[👋]</sup>.smallest[. They are estimated using the least squares approach.]

.footnote[.smallest[👋 Here we consider a simple situation where the variance is known. In practice, however, the variance is typically unknown so it needs to be estimated as well.]]

# Example: Reading ability assessment

In the reading ability example, we can formulate a linear regression model as follows:
$$\color{#e64173}{\text{Score}_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \color{#6A5ACD}{\text{Group}_i} + \beta_2 \color{#20B2AA}{\text{Age}_i} + \epsilon_i, \quad \epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2).$$
- $\color{#e64173}{\text{Score}_i}$: score of the DRP test of the $i$-th student.
- $\color{#6A5ACD}{\text{Group}_i}$: indicator of participation of the new directed reading activities for the $i$-th student (i.e. $\color{#6A5ACD}{\text{Group}_i} = 1$ if participate and $\color{#6A5ACD}{\text{Group}_i} = 0$ if not participate).
- $\color{#20B2AA}{\text{Age}_i}$: age of the $i$-th student. 

With this model the two groups can be compared as the age effect is taken into account. The goal of the educator is now to assess if $\beta_1$ is .pink[significantly larger than 0] (why??? 🤔).
